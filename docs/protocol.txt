CONNECT: When intiating a new connection to a broker a worker must validate 
             it's config.
    Parameters:
        config_type:     
            The format the worker accepts the config in. Can be JSON, XML
            or ZFL.

If the application already has a config, it will also pass a configversion
option.

CONFIG - Broker reply with configuration. This will be sent after CONNECT
    requests and when the Broker needs to inform the Worker of new CONFIG.
    Parameters:
        config_type:
            The format the config is in.
        config:
            The config.

NEEDBROKER - In the event that a worker is unable to connect to it's prefered
broker, it may try to connect to another one with a NEEDBROKER request. This
will include the worker identity and services offered. 

CHANGEBROKER - This is a reply back to a Worker or Client REQ/XREQ socket 
    telling it to connect to a different Broker. This can be a response to a 
    NEEDBROKER request or used when a Broker needs to push the Worker to 
    another Broker, say if it's coming down for maintenance or other reasons.

PING: This is the standard heartbeat request. When a Broker receives a PING
    from a Worker it will add it to the LRU queue if it's not already in it.
    Parameters:
        heartbeat_interval:
            The interval at which the broker can expect heartbeat requests
            from the worker. Worker only. 

        time:
            Time according to worker or client when heartbeat request was sent.
            If this is way off from the time on the server, then there
            is a problem and an error will be returned while the worker
            will be disconnected.

        config_version: 
            Worker only, configuration version.

PONG: This is the response to PING
    Parameters:
        time:
            Time on the Broker when the request was sent. This can be used
            to help keep servers in sync. This can also be used by the Worker
            to determine if it's slow in processing requests so it can stop
            sending PINGs if it's overloaded.

        config_version: 
            Configuration version.

TASK: This is the request asking a worker to do some work. This originates
    from the Client. The Router will add the following configuration items and
    will remove the worker from the LRU queue and add it to the wait queue.
    Parameters:
        time:
            Time according to worker when heartbeat request was sent.
            If this is way off from the time on the server, then there
            is a problem and an error will be returned while the worker
            will be disconnected.

        config_version: 
            Configuration version.

        id: This will be the identity of the frontend
            that made the request and the message id, used for routing.

        body: The body of the request.

TASKREPLY: This is the reply to a work request. If the id isn't in the wait
    queue for the Broker this message is discarded.
    Parameters:
        time:
            Time according to worker when heartbeat request was sent.
            If this is way off from the time on the server, then there
            is a problem and an error will be returned while the worker
            will be disconnected.

        config_version: 
            Configuration version.

        id: This will be the identity of the frontend
            that made the request and the message id, used for routing.

        body: The body of the request.
   errors about the work request, it will be up to the frontend to manage that.

ERROR:
    These are the Error codes a server may return to a client. These are based
    on HTTP status codes.
        301: Moved Permanently: Sent to Worker and Clients when the Broker
            needs them to move to another Broker. The Worker can expect a
            NEEDBROKER request to function correctly from the Broker.
        426: Upgrade Required. Sent when the Worker is sending a config version
            different from the Brokers. The Broker should issue a CONNECT to
            get the new config.
        444: No Response Message. Used when the Broker believes the client
            is malware.
        501: Not Implemented. Sent when the Worker or Client sends a request
            the server doesn't expect or isn't aware of.
        503: Service Unavailable. Sent when the Broker is not accepting
            connections. A Worker may attempt a NEEDBROKER request to see
            if it can be redirected. If this is supplied in response to a
            NEEDBROKER request the Worker should not retry.

FORCENEGOTIATE:
    Sent by broker to worker in the event the broker isn't sure if the worker
    is in an acceptable state. Upon getting this message from a broker a worker
    should initiate CONNECT.
