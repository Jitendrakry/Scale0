[ CLIENT CONFIG ]
This is config that each client stores. Both identity and services should
be sent with a CHECKCONFIG request.

identity:
    unique identifier for this client

services:
    List of services processed by the client.

group_config:
    config (including fallback group config) for group

prefered_broker: 
    This is the broker that the client should attempt to connect to.
    If it is unable to connect to this broker it should send a NEEDBROKER
    request to another broker in the group_config if any exist.


[ BROKER CONFIG ]
This details all the information a brokers require for operation. Not all
options need to be pushed to clients. What options are required for clients
is detailed in the [ CLIENT CONFIG ] section above.

identity:
    unique identifier for this broker

frontend_port: 
    The port on which frontends connect.

backend_port: 
    The port on which backends connect.

config_pub_port:
    The port on which this broker publishes new configurations.

config_sub_ports:
    The port(s) on which the broker listens for new configurations.

    *** The idea here is that everything, when possible, should listen for
    configuration changes from more than one source in order to provide
    reliability and redundancy. ****

state: joining, active, disabled
    joining is the default state when adding a broker to the network. Once
    it's received it's config it will go to an active state. Brokers can
    also be disabled. In a disabled state they will provide no response to
    requests except for a management request to re-enable.

peers: List of peer sockets to communicate with. This is the port used for
    heartbeat and work status communication.

default_heartbeat_interval:
    Clients can negotiate a longer heartbeat interval, but not a shorter one.

services: 
    list of services managed by the broker, or all

LRU:
    The least recently used list which will be a list of backends serviced by
    the broker. Each item on the list will have the following properties
        services: list of services the backend supports
        last_heartbeat: used to determine if the backend is alive or not.

error_clients:
    If due to a configuration issue or some other problem a client is
    repeatedly not negotiating correctly a client can be ignored as much
    as is possible with zeromq. 

group:
    This option may be blank, if groups aren't used in the network. Otherwise
    this is a single item for the group a broker is a member of.

fallback_groups:
    While a broker may be a member of only one group, it can have several
    fallback groups. Fallback groups are used to route clients to in the event
    that the primary group is unable to process it's request.

group_config:
    This is a list of group configs. The Broker should have it's own group
    config plus any fallback group configs as well. See [ GROUP CONFIG ]
    below for group config options.

[ GROUP CONFIG ]

name:
    Unique name for the group.

brokers:
    List of brokers in the group. Includes:
        identity: broker identity
        services: services served by broker
