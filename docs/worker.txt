[ WORKERS ]
Workers are applications that accept Tasks from Brokers and send Task replies
when they are done processing. The requirements for a Worker application are

 - Able to make ZeroMQ REQ sockets
 This is the core way that a Worker accepts tasks. REQ or XREQ depends on the
 ability of the worker to accept multiple tasks.

 - Follow the handshake and heartbeart requirements as follows.

 Initial Connection:
    Worker connects to the broker it's been told to connect to. It's up to
    the application developer to determine how an application is told which
    broker to connect to. This may be a command line switch, or the application
    can save it's config from a previous run and get the Broker connection
    information from there. Choice of REQ or XREQ is up to the client.

    An example connection looks like this.

    C ------CONNECT ----> B
    C <---- CONFIG ------ B
    C ----- PING -------> B
    C <---- PONG -------- B

    It's important to note that the PING is necessary to start receiving
    requests. This informs the Broker that the application is ready to take
    another Task.

    If the Worker is Asynchronous it should send a new PING immediately on
    receipt of a Task. This will allow the Broker to keep feeding the Worker
    Tasks as fast as it can. This also allows the developer of the Worker
    application to manage load internally. If the Worker is self aware enough
    to know when it should not be accepting more Tasks, it can simply not send
    a PING until it is ready.
