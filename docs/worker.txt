[ WORKERS ]
Workers are applications that accept Tasks from Brokers and send Task replies
when they are done processing. The requirements for a Worker application are

 - Able to make ZeroMQ REQ or XREQ sockets
 This is the core way that a Worker accepts tasks. REQ or XREQ depends on the
 ability of the worker to accept multiple tasks.

 - Follow the handshake and heartbeart requirements as follows.

 Initial Connection:
    Worker connects to the broker it's been told to connect to. It's up to
    the application developer to determine how an application is told which
    broker to connect to. This may be a command line switch, or the application
    can save it's config from a previous run and get the Broker connection
    information from there. Choice of REQ or XREQ is up to the client
