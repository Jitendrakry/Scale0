While writing documentation to build against I'll have ideas for things that
should be documented better later. That's what this file is for.

Protocol:
CHECKCONFIG - Requests a config update. Used by new clients/brokers initiating 
a connection. Option information could include configtype, so that ZFL, JSON
or XML can be used. The stack should not force a specific config parsing
requirement applications, instead should be able to provide it in common
formats to ease development against it. Scale0 provided libraries should
choose the parser that is the fastest, and not enforce a standard. Default will
be JSON if the type option is not set.

If the application already has a config, it will also pass a configversion
option.

CONFIGACK - Broker reply when CHECKCONFIG version request matches the version
on the broker.

CONFIG - Broker reply with configuration. Type will be specified as part of
the request.

READY - This is the client telling the broker it's ready for a request. The
request should include options for the services provided by the client and 
the current configversion.
