The broker is the core of the Scale0 project. It provides the application
logic and standards for peer and client connections. 

Peers are defined as other applications acting in the broker role, whether
they are other Scale0 brokers or provided by other means.

Clients are be frontends or backends, or coming from zeromq documentation
clients or workers.

Every attempt is made to stay in accord with any standards that exist
on the zeromq website, [ url goes here, working offline right now ]. The
other issues Scale0 offers solutions for are reliability, scalability and
mangement flexibility.

Scale0 brokers will provide the following services:

Service Discovery: In order to meet the requirements of being service
agnostic, service discovery will need to be built in. Worker clients will
be able to state the serivce(s) they provide on connection to the network
and change that configuration realtime. Other core services will be built
on this framework. 

Configuration: A peer or client on startup should only need to be informed
of at least one broker to connect to. It will the request the configuration
it needs on startup. Not all brokers will be required to provide 
configuration services. However, at least one server per network will need
to provide the service.

Heartbeat: Heartbeat will be the way that clients and peers are monitored
for availability. This will also be used to keep a configuration up to
date on configuration service brokers. Heartbeat service servers can be
configured to share their heartbeat table with other peers using push or
pull. For example, in a active/standby peer topology the master can receive
all heartbeart information and share it with the standby. Pull can be used
by peers requesting information about available workers clients.

Management: A built in http management server for the broker and network.
A command line mode will exist where the administrator can view and make
network level changes. Features will include listing all peers and clients,
the services offered and current state. Optionally some data can pushed
to remote services, useful for trending for example. Scale0 should ship
with an availble http based management front end, which should be disabled
by default. Security vs ease of administration should be an exercise left
for the maintainers of the network. [ this will need to be defined better
later ].
