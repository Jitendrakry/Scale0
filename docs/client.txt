Clients are applications that interact with Scale0. There are requirements
and protocols that a client must meet and have support for in order to
interact with a broker.

The first requirement is that the application must support zeromq. All 
communication to and from the brokers happen via zeromq sockets.

Full support for zeromq sockets is include, so tcp, ipc and inproc are all
acceptable. 

[ note this next section is based off my understanding of zeromq after reading
the guide. Parts of this may just be plain wrong or even dumb. That's what the
next phase of actual code development will help prove or disprove. ]

Connection Process:
Clients on start will need to make a REQ connection to a broker
with a CHECKCONFIG request. CHECKCONFIG requests can include optional
information such as configtype and configversion.


If the configversion option passed by the client matches the current
configversion on the broker the broker will respond with a CONFIGACK. Otherwise
the broker will reply with a CONFIG response, which will include the config
[ come back here and add example config ].

The client will then make REQ or XREQ to the brokers specificed by the
config with a READY.
