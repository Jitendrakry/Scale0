[ CLIENT ]
Clients are the applications that generate Tasks and send them to the Broker
for processing. These are the classic frontend applications. The requirement
for the frontend are to be able to support ZeroMQ REQ or XREQ connections and
follow protocol requirements for a Client.

An example connection would look like this.

C ------TASK ----> B
C <-- TASKREPLY -- B

Brokers will also accept PING requests and reply with PONG in order for the
Client to determine if the Broker is available. NEEDBROKER requests can be
sent to the Broker in order to get a new Broker if the Broker is available to
serivce that request.

For more information about other responses please see the protocol document.
It's expected that all Clients will be able to handle all error codes for
example.
