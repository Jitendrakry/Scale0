Scale0 - A dynamic service oriented smart load balancer.

What does that mean?

Dynamic - Scale0 is configured by the backend workers that connect to it.
There are no virtual servers, pool members or other configuration necessary.

Service Oriented - Scale0 routes frontend request to backends by the services
the backends announce they support.

Smart Load Balancer - Scale0 uses a least recently used queue methodology to 
route requests.

Huh? I still don't get it.

Say you have a dynamic website and you want to have multiple backend servers
processing requests received by a frontend webserver. A typical scenario might
be several Tornado or node.js servers being proxied by an Nginx server.

A traffic spike happens, you need to get more backends up to handle the load.
You hopefully have your Nginx servers load balanced so you can reconfigure them
to support more backends. Your architecture might look like

                                        ------------------
                                        | Backend Server |
                                        ------------------

                      ----------------  ------------------
                      | Nginx Server |  | Backend Server |
                      ----------------  ------------------

-----------------                       -----------------
| Load Balancer |                       | Backend Server |
-----------------                       ------------------

                      ----------------  ------------------
                      | Nginx Server |  | Backend Server |
                      ---------------   ------------------
                                        ------------------
                                        | Backend Server |
                                        ------------------



Adding more servers will require reconfiguring the nginx servers.
